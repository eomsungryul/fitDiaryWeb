Hive Virtual Columns
============================

Hive 0.8.0 provides support for two virtual columns:

One is INPUT__FILE__NAME, which is the input file's name for a mapper task.

the other is BLOCK__OFFSET__INSIDE__FILE, which is the current global file position.

For block compressed file, it is the current block's file offset, which is the current block's first byte's file offset.

Simple Examples
===============

::

    select INPUT__FILE__NAME, key, BLOCK__OFFSET__INSIDE__FILE from src;

    select key, count(INPUT__FILE__NAME) from src group by key order by key;

    select * from src where BLOCK__OFFSET__INSIDE__FILE > 12000 order by key;
